The code runs an animation showing it calculating the value of Pi based on the MonteCarlo method.

Run the code as you would any other python programs.
python main.py

In order to control the number of samples used add --samples [number of samples] to the run command.
Examples:

python main.py --samples 100,000,000
python main.py --samples 100512456
python main.py --samples 234'786'751
